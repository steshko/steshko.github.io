      <img src="../resources/subaru-brz.jpg" alt="Subaru BRZ" class="page-picture">
      <p class="page-text">The next generation Subaru BRZ and its technical brother, the Toyota GR86 went on sale in Fall 2021 for the 2022 model year, yet 6 months there is still a shortage. The BRZ/86 is a compact sports car starting at $27,995 for the Subaru and $27,700 for the Toyota making it one of the more affordable sports car offerings. Additionally, both variants are available with a six-speed manual – which is quite rare these days – with a six-speed automatic available as an option. The shortage is due to firstly, the global chip shortage impacting all automakers and due to high demand for the car. The new BRZ/86 have received excellent reviews from the media, such as a 9.5/10 from Car and Driver, and are popular amongst enthusiasts for their affordable price and the availability of a manual option. If you are ordering a new manual BRZ/86 today you can expect to wait anywhere between a month to three months depending on the spec and color, although you can probably pick up an automatic tomorrow – but you shouldn’t. This goes to show that manuals remain popular amongst enthusiasts and more car manufacturers should take note.
