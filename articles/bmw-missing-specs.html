      <h1 class="page-title">New Subary BRZ and Toyota GR86 Shortage</h1>
      <p class="page-text">If you have opened a BMW 2 series configurator recently and specced Vernessa leather seats you may have noticed the items added include “Passenger Lumbar Delete” and “Passenger Width Delete” as two options added crediting you $275. This is because BMW, like others is facing a chip shortage and are removing chip intensive options from their vehicles in order to be able to get them into the hands of customers sooner. Other BMW options that have been impacted include the live cockpit display and surround view, although these are still available to spec, your cars delivery date may be postponed. It is increasingly difficult to find new BMWs with these options if not ordering from the factory which has led to an even greater increase in price for 2019 and 2020 cars that have them equipped compared to same model year cars that don’t. Overall, it is sad that passenger lumbar can support can’t be specced on the G42 2 series, although it comes as standard on the driver side and ultimately – do BMW drivers really care about their passenger?
